## Overview

This Rakefile can be used to create a skeleton Rally app for use with Rally's App SDK.  You must have Ruby and the rake gem installed.

Available tasks are:

    rake build                      # Build a deployable app which includes all JavaScript and CSS resources inline
    rake clean                      # Clean all generated output
    rake debug                      # Build a debug version of the app, useful for local development
    rake jslint                     # Run jslint on all JavaScript files used by this app
    rake new[app_name,sdk_version]  # Create an app with the provided name (and optional SDK version)
